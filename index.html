    <h1>Alex Vadsoongnern</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am always driven and carrier focused, therefore I am actively in search for a room of improvement as well as personally development.</p>
        
    <p>Working in communication and service is my passion, so I am sure to deliver the best satisfaction in customers' service. Most of my work experiences I have gained in the past decade is in hospitality, primarily as a Hotel Receptionist and a Sales Agent.</p>

    <p>Recently I was employed for an Operation Officer at one of the most luxury holiday destination agency at Brilliant Ideas by Atlas Reizen in Belgium. This is a wonderful opportunity for me to be able to showcase my skills, qualifications, experiences, and competencies, therefor hopefully I can share these values to the team and the company.</p>

    <p>Along side my profession, I am a self-taught software developer, learning from home via various sources such as Udemy, Grasshopper, SoloLearn, and Mimo on my free time. In the past few years, during the unemployment period I attempted the study for 6 months at AP College in Antwerp, then attended the booth-camp for 1 month at Campus 19, until i was recently employed by Brilliant Ideas.</p>
